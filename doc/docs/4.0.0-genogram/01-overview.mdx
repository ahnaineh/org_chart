# Genogram Overview

Visualize complex family relationships with multi-generational trees and relationship indicators.

## Core Concepts

- **Two Parents**: Each node can have a father and mother
- **Multiple Spouses**: Support for multiple marriages
- **Gender-Based Layout**: Automatic positioning based on gender
- **Relationship Lines**: Visual indicators for marriages, divorces
- **Multi-Generation**: Automatic generation-based positioning

## Architecture

- **Controller**: Manages family data and relationships
- **Widget**: Renders the family tree visualization
- **Model**: Your custom family member structures

## Basic Usage

```dart
Genogram<FamilyMember>(
  controller: controller,
  builder: (details) => YourNodeWidget(),
  edgeConfig: GenogramEdgeConfig(),
  marriageStatusProvider: (person, spouse) => MarriageStatus.married,
)
```
